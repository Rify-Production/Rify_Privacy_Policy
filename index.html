<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 10 January 2026</p>

<section>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>RIFY INC.</strong> ("Rify", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your
information when you use the <strong>Rify</strong> mobile application ("App").
</p>
<p>
By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>

</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Camera and Photos</h2>
<p>
Rify only allows photo uploads captured directly through the device camera. The App does not access your photo library.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Location Data</h2>
<p>
Location data is used to provide nearby, location-based content and functionality. Location access is required for core
features of the App.
</p>
<p>
We do not sell or rent your location data to third parties.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We use collected information to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Operate and maintain the App</li>
<li>Provide location-based features</li>
<li>Display user-generated content</li>
<li>Improve performance and user experience</li>
<li>Ensure safety and prevent misuse</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1 Advertising</h3>
<p>
Rify displays advertisements through third-party advertising providers such as Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). All ads are
<strong>non-personalised</strong>, meaning they are not targeted based on personal data or user behavior outside the App.
Ads may use contextual information and limited device data (such as device type or general location) to display relevant content.
</p>
<p>
We do not collect identifiers for advertising purposes without your consent, and users under 16 are not targeted.
</p>

<h3>4.2 App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h3>
<p>
Rify does not track you across apps or websites owned by other companies for advertising purposes.  
No tracking consent is required for the use of non-personalised ads in this App.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal data.
</p>
<p>
We may share information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>With service providers (e.g. Firebase) to operate the App, store data, analyze usage, and improve performance</li>
<li>If required by law or legal process</li>
<li>To protect rights, safety, and security</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.1 Service Providers</h3>
<p>
We use third-party service providers, including Firebase, to operate the App, store and synchronize user data, and improve
app performance. Firebase may collect analytics and crash reporting information, but this data is used only to improve
the App’s functionality and security.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
Data is stored using third-party services such as Firebase. We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but
no system is completely secure.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the App or comply with legal obligations.
</p>
<p>
You may request deletion of your content or account, subject to technical and legal limitations.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Rify is not intended for users under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
16. Users under 16 are not targeted with personalised ads.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information.
