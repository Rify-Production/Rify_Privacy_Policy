<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 January 2026</p>

<section>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>RIFY PTY LTD</strong> ("Rify", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects
your information when you use the <strong>Rify</strong> mobile application ("App").
</p>
<p>
By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
</section>

</ul>

<p>
Rify only permits photo uploads captured directly via the device camera. The App does not access your personal photo library.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Location Data</h2>
<p>
Location data is used to provide nearby, location-based content and functionality. Access to location is required for core
App features.
</p>
<p>
We do not sell or rent your location data to third parties.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Operate and maintain the App</li>
<li>Provide location-based features</li>
<li>Display user-generated content</li>
<li>Enhance performance, security, and user experience</li>
<li>Ensure safety, prevent misuse, and moderate content</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1 Advertising</h3>
<p>
The App may display advertisements via third-party providers such as Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). All ads are
<strong>non-personalised</strong> and are not targeted using personal data or user behavior outside the App.
Ads may use contextual information or limited device data (e.g., device type or general location) to display relevant content.
</p>
<p>
No advertising identifiers are collected without consent, and users under 16 are not targeted.
</p>

<h3>4.2 App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h3>

Rify does not track you across apps or websites owned by other companies for advertising purposes.
No tracking consent is required to use non-personalised ads in this App.

<h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in limited circumstances:

<li>When required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
<li>To protect rights, property, safety, or security, including that of Rify or other users</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>6. Service Providers</h2>
<p>
We engage third-party service providers, including Firebase, to store data, provide analytics, and support App functionality.
Such providers may collect analytics or crash reporting data, but this is used solely to maintain, improve, and secure the App.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>7. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
All user data is stored using secure third-party services. While we implement reasonable technical and organizational measures
to protect your information, no system is completely secure.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain your information only as long as necessary to operate the App or comply with legal obligations.  
You may request deletion of your account or content, subject to technical and legal limitations.
